(E.g.,/usr/local/python\\nis a popular alternative location.)\\nOn Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\, though \\nyou can change this when you’re running the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can \\ntype the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:\\nset path=%path%;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\\\nT\\nyping an end-of-ﬁle character (Control-Don Unix,Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes\\nthe interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing\\nthe following command:quit().\\nThe interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion\\non systems that support readline. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is\\nsupported is typing Control-P to the ﬁrst Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line\\nediting; see AppendixInteractive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If\\nnothing appears to happen, or if^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to\\nuse backspace to remove characters from the current line.\\nThe interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty\\ndevice, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a ﬁle name argument or with a ﬁle\\nas standard input, it reads and executes ascript from that ﬁle.\\nA second way of starting the interpreter ispython -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s)\\nin command, analogous to the shell’s-c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other\\ncharacters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quotecommand in its entirety with single\\nquotes.\\nSome Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked usingpython -m module [arg] ...,\\nwhich executes the source ﬁle formodule as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.\\nWhen a script ﬁle is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode\\nafterwards. This can be done by passing-i before the script.\\n1 On\\nUnix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not\\nconﬂict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.\\n5')]\n"
